# Polygon

A program which experiments and practices with classes, objects, and overall object oriented programing.

The program creates an object of class ConvexPolygon. The object is a polygon itself. This object can be called to learn information about it like interior angles, length, etc...

The program also has a function which lets the user know if it is a regular polygon, i.e. all edges and interior angles in the polyon are equal.
